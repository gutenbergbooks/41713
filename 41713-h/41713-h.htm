<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>This is a modest little volume. It consists but
of selections from the Editor's note-book, and its
object is but to amuse. It does not even aspire
to be read consecutively. The Compiler's hope
is only that it may be found a pleasant companion
at spare moments&mdash;that it may be considered
handy for the pocket, and be thought agreeable to
dip into.</p>

<p>To that end, two things have been aimed at in
selecting&mdash;brevity and variety. There is scarcely
anything in the volume that cannot be read
almost at a glance, and the matter ranges over
a wide extent of literary effort&mdash;over play and
poem, over essay and novel, over maxim and epigram,
over memoir and diary. There is pun, and
there is parody; there is satire, and there is sarcasm.
In a word, the little book may say, with
Lafontaine, "Diversité c'est ma devise." There is
diversity even in the arrangement, which consists
merely of a general alternation of the prose and
verse. For the rest, the quips and quiddities are
in intentional disorder.</p>

<p>Let it be added that, though there are a few
anonymous passages, most are duly attributed to
their writers, together with references to the
volumes from which they have been taken. In
this, every care has been exercised to arrive at
accuracy. The idea of completeness is, of course,
foreign to a selection of this sort, and it may be
mentioned that the Editor has been specially
anxious to avoid as much as possible the ground
covered by Mr. Leigh in his "Jeux d'Esprit," and
by Mr. Dobson in his "Literary Frivolities." His
aim, indeed, has been to take the freshest and least
hackneyed of the passages in his collection, though
he has not hesitated to include a venerable saying
when it has seemed to him as good as it is venerable.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Compiler desires to express
in the most hearty manner his indebtedness to
those numerous living writers whose bright and
airy fancies form, in his opinion, one of the chief
attractions of the book. He ought, perhaps, to
apologize to those writers for presenting their
fancies in a manner so generally fragmentary and
disconnected. But that the contents of the book
should be thus disconnected and fragmentary was
part and parcel of its plan and origin, and, that
being the case, the Editor hopes to be excused.
He may state that, in those few cases where a
piece of verse is given entire, it is distinguished
by the presence of a heading. The epigrams,
maxims, and anecdotes are, of course, reproduced
as written&mdash;being, in their very nature, of the
brevity essential to a quip.</p>

<p>Further: on the principle that no book, however
unpretending, should be without an <a href="#Page_265">Index</a>, the
Compiler has supplied one for the present volume.</p>

OBUS was very amusing. He is a great authority
on Indian matters. We talked of the insects
and the snakes, and he said a thing which
reminded me of his brother Sydney: "Always, sir,
manage to have at your table some fleshy blooming
young writer or cadet, just come out, that the mosquitoes
may stick to him, and leave the rest of the company
alone."</p>

ex-Advocate-General, and happened on one
occasion to be engaged in argument with an excellent
physician touching the merits of their respective professions.
"You must admit," urged Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, "that
your profession does not make angels of men." "No,"
was the retort, "there you have the best of it; yours
certainly gives them the first chance."</p>

HE newspapers lately have taught us to know<br />
How some strong-minded hens are beginning to crow.<br />
But, dear ladies, beware: take the word of a friend,<br />

With the brightest of <i>spoons</i> would be war to the <i>knife</i><br />
In political contests 'twixt husband and wife;<br />
And the sentence of doom might be sudden and brief<br />
If a feminine subaltern jilted her chief.<br />

in the glass; "look at it, there's a picture for you!"
"Yes," said Jerrold, regarding it intently, "very fine,

liking the end very much. That soon spread to the
middle and the beginning, because I couldn't have the

"feed a cold and starve a fever." I had both.
So I thought it best to feed myself up for the
cold, and then keep dark and let the fever starve awhile.
In a case of this kind, I seldom do things by halves.
I ate pretty heartily. I conferred my custom upon a
stranger who had just opened his restaurant that morning.
He waited near me in respectful silence, until I had
finished feeding my cold, when he inquired if the people
about Virginia were much afflicted with colds? I told
him I thought they were. He then went out and took in

EARLY one hundred years ago, my grandfather,
Captain William Locker, was at dinner, and a
servant-boy, lately engaged, was handing him a
tray of liqueurs, in different-sized glasses. Being in the
middle of an anecdote to his neighbour, he mechanically
held out his hand towards the tray, but, as people often
do when they are thinking of something else, he did not
take a glass. The boy thought he was hesitating which
liqueur he would have, and, like a good fellow, wishing
to help his master, he pointed to one particular glass,
and whispered, "That's the biggest, sir."</p>

ONK LEWIS was a great favourite at Oatlands.
One day after dinner, as the duchess was leaving
the room, she whispered something in Lewis's
ear. He was much affected, his eyes filling with tears.
We asked him what was the matter. "Oh," replied
Lewis, "the duchess spoke so <i>very</i> kindly to me!"
"My dear fellow," said Colonel Armstrong, "pray don't
cry; I dare say she didn't mean it."</p>

was much exercised by the threats and terrors of
the law. He had a little plot of ground at the
back of the house, marked out as his own by a row of
oyster-shells, which a maid one day threw away as rubbish.
He went straight to the drawing-room, where his

circle, and said very solemnly: "Cursed be Sally; for it
is written, 'Cursed is he that removeth his neighbour's

Whether 'tis nobler for our frames to suffer<br />
The shows and follies of outrageous custom,<br />
Or to take fire&mdash;against a sea of zealots&mdash;<br />
And, by consuming, end them? To Urn&mdash;to keep&mdash;<br />
No more: and while we keep, to say we end<br />
Contagion and the thousand graveyard ills<br />
That flesh is heir to&mdash;'tis a consume-ation<br />
Devoutly to be wished!

authors to eat fish, because the phosphorus
in it makes brains. So far you are
correct. But I cannot help you to a decision about the
amount you need to eat&mdash;at least, not with certainty. If
the specimen composition you send is about your fair
usual average, I should judge that perhaps a couple of
whales would be all you would want for the present.
Not the largest kind, but simply good, middling-sized

was said on the subject of religious persecution,
on which [Whately] remarked, "It is no wonder
that some English people have a taste for persecuting on
account of religion, since it is the first lesson that most
are taught in their nurseries." His friend expressed his
incredulity, and denied that <i>he</i>, at least, had been taught
it. "Are you sure?" replied Dr. Whately. "What

HAT the mischief do you suppose you want with a
post-office at Baldwin's Ranch? It would not
do you any good. If any letters came there,
you couldn't read them, you know; and besides, such
letters as ought to pass through, with money in them, for
other localities, would not be likely to <i>get</i> through, you
must perceive at once; and that would make trouble for
us all. No; don't bother about a post-office at your
camp. What you want is a nice jail, you know&mdash;a nice,
substantial jail, and a free school. These will be a
lasting benefit to you. These will make you really contented
and happy.

inquire after a young lady who had sprained
her ankle. Lewis, on being asked how she
was, had said in the black's presence, 'The doctor has
seen her, put her legs straight, and the poor chicken is

been here; she has laid eggs, and she and the chickens
are doing well.'"</p>

&nbsp;SCOTTISH Scottish clergyman had some years since
been cited before the Ecclesiastical Assembly
at Edinburgh, to answer to a charge brought
against him of great irreverence in religious matters, and
Sir Walter [Scott] was employed by him to arrange his
defence. The principal fact alleged against him was his
having asserted, in a letter which was produced, that "he
considered Pontius Pilate to be a very ill-used man, as
he had done more for Christianity than all the other <i>nine
Apostles</i> put together." The fact was proved, and suspension
followed.</p>

OOD little girls ought not to make mouths at
their teachers for every trifling offence. This
kind of retaliation should only be resorted to
under peculiarly aggravating circumstances.</p>

<p>If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust,
while one of your more fortunate little playmates
has a costly china one, you should treat her with a show
of kindness nevertheless. And you ought not to attempt
to make a forcible swap with her, unless your conscience
would justify you in it, and you know you are able to
do it.</p>

<p>If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to
reply that you won't. It is better and more becoming
to intimate that you will do as she bids you, and then
afterwards act quietly in the matter according to the
dictates of your better judgment.

OB, wanting a partner, thought he'd be blest,<br />
If, of all womankind, he selected the Best;<br />
For, said he, of all evils that compass the globe,<br />
A bad wife would most try the patience of Job.<br />
The Best, then, he chose, and made bone of his bone,<br />
Though 'twas clear to his friends she'd be Best left alone;<br />
For, though Best of her sex, she's the weakest of all,<br />
If it's true that the weakest must go to the Wall.<br />

&nbsp;LITTLE incident Charlotte Cushman once related
to me. She said a man in the gallery of
a theatre made such a disturbance that the play
could not proceed. Cries of "Throw him over" arose
from all parts of the house, and the noise became furious.
All was tumultuous above until a sweet and gentle female
voice was heard in the pit, exclaiming, "No! I pray
you, don't throw him over! I beg of you, dear friends,
don't throw him over, but&mdash;<i>kill him where he is</i>."</p>

&nbsp;HOPE I appreciate the value of children. We
should soon come to nothing without them.
Without them the common school would languish.
But the problem is, what to do with them in a
garden. For they are not good to eat, and there is a law
against making away with them. The law is not very
well enforced, it is true; for people do thin them out
with constant dosing, paregoric, and soothing-syrups, and
scanty clothing. But I, for one, feel it would not be
right, aside from the law, to take the life, even of the
smallest child, for the sake of a little fruit, more or less,
in the garden. I may be wrong; but these are my sentiments,
and I am not ashamed of them.</p>

F Diggle, Barham used to tell many absurd stories.
The most amusing of his practical jokes was one
in which Barham had a share. The two boys
having, in the course of one of their walks, discovered a
Quakers' meeting-house, forthwith procured a penny tart
of a neighbouring pastry-cook; furnished with this,
Diggle marched boldly into the building, and, holding up
the delicacy in the midst of the grave assembly, said with
perfect solemnity, "Whoever speaks first shall have this
pie." "Friend, go thy way," commenced a drab-coloured
gentleman, rising, "go thy way, and&mdash;&mdash;" "The pie's
yours, sir!" exclaimed Master Diggle, politely, and
placing it before the astounded speaker, hastily effected
his escape.</p>

"Good God!" I said, "is he dead?" "He is as dead,
sir," rejoined the gentleman, "as a door nail. But we
must all die, Mr. Dickens, sooner or later, my dear sir."
"Ah!" I said; "yes, to be sure. Very true. But
what did he die of?" The gentleman burst into a flood
of tears, and said, in a voice broken by emotion, "He
christened his youngest child, sir, with a toasting fork!"</p>

HE late Bishop of Exeter and Baron Alderson
were sitting next each other at a public dinner.
After the usual toasts had been drunk, the
health of "The Navy" was proposed. Lord Campbell,
expecting to have to return thanks for "The Bar,"
and not having heard the toast distinctly, got up. On
which the late bishop whispered to Baron Alderson,
"What is Campbell about? What is he returning thanks
for the Navy for?" "Oh," answered the witty judge,
"he has made a mistake. He thinks the word is
spelt with a K."</p>

R. MACCULLOCH, the eminent political
economist, in dining with us, a few days after
[an aeronautical friend had made an ascent],
was most anxious to learn where he had descended
on this occasion. The answer was, "Amongst the flats
of Essex." "A most appropriate locality," said my
distinguished countryman, "and one which shows how
true it is that 'birds of a feather flock together.'"

IS ridiculous for a lord to print verses. It is well
enough to make them to please himself, but to
make them public is foolish. If a man in his

go into Fleet Street, and sit upon a stall, and twirl
a bandstring, or play with a rush, then all the boys in

HE Bishop of Exeter, in the course of conversation
at a dinner-party, mentioned that many
years since, while trout-fishing, he lost his watch
and chain, which he supposed had been pulled from his
pocket by the bough of a tree. Some time afterwards,
when staying in the same neighbourhood, he took a
stroll by the side of the river, and came to the secluded
spot where he supposed he had lost his valuables, and
there, to his surprise and delight, he found them under a
bush. The anecdote, vouched for by the word of a
bishop, astonished the company; but this was changed
to amusement by his son's inquiring whether the watch,
when found, was going. "No," replied the bishop;
"the wonder was that it was not gone."
